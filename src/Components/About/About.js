            <p>This is my playlist, made by (Me, Myself and I) as a project for Winc Academy.<br/> 
                Made with love and hard work, pffff. <br/>
                Made with React and Redux, don't like Redux, because i have to think differently, but i tried?!<br/>
                You can see I like a lot of music styles.<br/>
                You can add or remove songs, but this is my list!!
